# Tik_tak_toeGame
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. The game allows two players to take turns selecting positions on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
